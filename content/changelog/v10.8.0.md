## New setting to open the panel view on supported files

With the new setting `frontMatter.panel.openOnSupportedFile`, you can now configure if the Front Matter CMS panel view should open automatically when you open a supported file. The default value is `false`.

```json
{
  "frontMatter.panel.openOnSupportedFile": true
}
```

## New placeholders for the slug template setting

Two new placeholders have been added to the slug template setting:

- `{{fileName}}`: This will be replaced with the filename of the file.
- `{{sluggedFileName}}`: This will be replaced with the slugged version of the filename.

> **Info**: You can find more information about in the [slug placeholders](/docs/content-creation/placeholders#slug-placeholders) documentation section.

## Improved filename sanitization

The filename sanitization has been improved to handle more edge cases.
