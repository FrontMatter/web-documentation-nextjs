## New data files dashboard

Data files/folders are pieces of content that do not belong to any markdown content, but live on their own. Most of the time, these data files are used to store additional information about your project/blog/website that will be used to render the content.

For example: navigation, social media links, contacts, etc.

In version 6, we added a new dashboard that will help you manage your data files.

> More information about this data files dashboard can be found in the [dashboard - data view](/docs/dashboard#data-view) section of the documentation.

## Additional media sort options

On the media dashboard, we allow you to sort your media by the following options:

## Run bulk content actions straight from the dashboard

When defining "bulk" content scripts (scripts that run on multiple content items at once), you can run them straight from the dashboard.

## Multi-dimensional content type fields

Content types now allow you to define multi-dimensional content type fields. Using this new type means that you can specify a field that contains other sub-fields.

![Multi-dimensional content type fields](/releases/v6.0.0/multi-dimensional-content-type-fields.png)

Example of how it looks in the content type setting:

```json
"frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes": [
  {
    "name": "multi-dimension",
    "pageBundle": false,
    "fields": [
      {
        "title": "Title",
        "name": "title",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "title": "Description",
        "name": "description",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "title": "Photo",
        "type": "fields",
        "name": "photo",
        "fields": [
          {
            "title": "Title",
            "name": "title",
            "type": "string"
          },
          {
            "title": "URL",
            "name": "url",
            "type": "image"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

> For more information how to use multi-dimensional content type fields, check out the [sub-fields](/docs/content-types#sub-fields-/-objects)) section of the content type documentation.

## SvelteKit support

By default, Front Matter supports: `md`, `markdown`, and `mdx`. If you want to support other types, just add these to the `frontMatter.content.supportedFileTypes` setting.

```json
{
  "frontMatter.content.supportedFileTypes": [ "md", "markdown", "mdx", "svx" ]
}
```

This setting allows you to add support for SvelteKit and probably other static site generators and frameworks.

## JSON front matter support

We also support `JSON` written in `front matter` syntax. You can change the behaviour of our parser, by setting the `frontMatter.taxonomy.frontMatterType` to `JSON`. The extension now supports `YAML` (default), `TOML`, and `JSON`.

Usage:

```markdown
---
{
  "title": "My title",
  "description": "My description"
}
---
```

## Content type and template fields now support placeholders

In this release, we added support for the following placeholders, which you can use in the content type and template fields:

- `{{title}}`
- `{{slug}}`
- `{{now}}`

But there is more! You can also add your own placeholders to make it even easier to use. Check out our [placeholders](/docs/content-types#placeholders) section for more information.

## Start the local development server from the UI

We added the option to specify the start command for your local development server. Once provided, you will be able to start your local development server from the UI.

![Local server command configuration](/releases/v6.0.0/local-server.png)

> If you already defined your framework or SSG via the `frontMatter.framework.id` setting, we provide a default start command for you. You can override this by providing your own start command.

![Start action for local server](/releases/v6.0.0/local-server-start.png)

## Supporters & backers can hide the support links

If you are one of the Front Matter supporters/backers, you can hide the support links from the UI. We know it is not much, but we want to give something small back, and what is better than a bit of space? 🤓

By default, you'll see the following support links:

![Support links shown by default](/releases/v6.0.0/support-links.png)

When you log in via GitHub, you'll see the following:
