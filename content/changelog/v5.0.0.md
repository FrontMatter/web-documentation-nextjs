## Media dashboard redesigned + additional features

The media dashboard has been redesigned to have better folder support. It now allows you to navigate through all your folders, go back to the previous one via the breadcrumb, create new folders, and more.

### Metadata support for media files

You are now able to add your own metadata to the media files. This functionality comes in handy when you use it in combination with a snippet to insert your media files. More information at: [media view](/docs/dashboard#media-view).

The content type its `string` fields now support you to set the field to behave as a singleline of text input.

```
{
  "name": "title",
  "type": "string",
  "single": true
}
```

> **Info**: Find out more of the choice improvements at the [supported field types](/docs/content-types#supported-field-types) section.

## Support for workspaces with multiple folders

As some of you are using workspaces with multiple folders. Front Matter will now first validate each folder and find out in which it needs to be enabled. If it cannot decide which one to take, it will ask you.
